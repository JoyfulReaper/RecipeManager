#### The idea:
A suite of applications for managing recipes:
- A console applications. (Currently in progress)
- A WinForms Application. (After console app)
- A WPF Application. (After WinForms, possible after ASP.NET)
- An ASP.NET Application. (Last step)

#### The Tech stuff:
- Using Entity Framework Core as an ORM and 
- Serilog for structured logging. 
- Implements the Repository and Unit Of Work patterns.
